= Asciidoctor Gradle Plugin: Examples

This repository is a fork of the http://asciidoctor.github.io/asciidoctor-gradle-examples[asciidoctor-gradle-examples
repo] in order to investigate generating HTML slide decks and PDF documents from AsciiDoc files in the same Gradle
module. Then, multiple modules were added along with a task to zip up all the generated artifacts from the submodules
into a single distribution.

To generate the HTML slides and PDFs, execute `gradlew asciidoctor`.

To create the distribution zip file, execute `gradlew buildDistributionZip`. The zip will be located in build/distributions.
